According to [[MN-M520 Leadership]], **Aspects of authentic leadership** are:
- Intrapersonal: about the leader themselves
- Interpersonal: a relational perspective which places emphasis on positive role modelling to enable well being and sustainable performance
- Developmental: an approach (style/skills) to be learned

**Personal Attributes** are Confident, Hopeful, Optimistic, Resilient and **Behavioural components** are Relational transparency, Self awareness, Internalised moral perspective, Balanced/unbiased process. Based on Kernis, M. H., & Goldman, B. M. (2006). A multicomponent conceptualization of authenticity: Theory and research. Advances in experimental social psychology, 38, 283-357.

> Relational transparency: refers to presenting one's authentic self as opposed to one's fake self
> 
> Balanced processing: Balanced processing refers to how leaders objectively analyse all relevant data before making decisions. They also challenge their deeply held views.
> 
> Internalised moral perspective: refers to an integrated form of selfregulation; not reliant on others
> 
> Self awareness: occurs when individuals are aware of their own existence, and what constitutes that existence within the context with which they operate over time. Avolio and Gardner (2005) recognise four elements of self-awareness that they think are especially relevant to the development of authentic leadership: values, cognitions regarding identity, emotions, and motives

Think about when these might be strengths but could these also be problematic?


**Foundation of authentic leadership** according to [[MN-M520 Leadership]]
- Incorporates aspects of traits, skills and styles but also recognises relational aspects with followers facilitated by organisational culture
- Allied to a general move towards notions of authenticity in various areas of life and appropriates notions of ethics, trust and truth
- Typically measured via self-report questionnaires (see Gardner et al., 2011 for a discussion of the various measures and their use) 
- Builds on trend for positive psychology:

[[Authenticity Paradox]] // based on [[MN-M520 Leadership]]
 - Problematic relationship between authenticity and success: becoming more successful reduces the perception of authenticity
 - Trying too hard to be authentic can be seen as inauthentic especially when leaders engage in activities in order to create a more authentic presence.
 - Sticking to a rigid view of authenticity can limit growth especially in new or uncertain environments
